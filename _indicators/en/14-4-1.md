title: Proportion of fish stocks within biologically sustainable levels
lang: en
nazwa_wskaznika: <b>14.4.1 Proportion of fish stocks within biologically sustainable levels</b>
cel: Goal 14. Life below water
zadanie: >-
  14.4 By 2020, effectively regulate harvesting and end overfishing, illegal,
  unreported and unregulated fishing and destructive fishing practices and
  implement science-based management plans, in order to restore fish stocks in
  the shortest time feasible, at least to levels that can produce maximum
  sustainable yield as determined by their biological characteristics.
definicja: >-
  <p>The indicator specifices amound of resources in the world and a share of
  fish stocks on biologically renewable level (Safe Biological Limits, SBL).
  When assessing the resources are classified into three categories:
  overexploited, fully exploited and under-exploited.</p> <p>The proportion of
  fish stocks within safe biological limits (i.e. greater than threshold biomass
  with biomass stocks, calle in relation to the number of stocks fully exploited
  and under-exploited; the indicator includes those stocks for which biomass
  threshold sets.</p> <p>The indicator determines the level of progress towards
  the sustainable management of fish stocks, in which the aim is to avoid
  overfishing and to maintain in a secure environmentally limits the effect of
  fishing on stocks, species and ecosystems.</p>

  <p>The United Nations Convention on the Law of the Sea, to which the Union is
  a party, imposes obligations related to the protection, including maintenance
  or restoration of the population of the fished species at levels that the
  <b>Maximum Sustainable Yield (MSY)</b>.</p>

  <p><b>Maximum Sustainable Catch</b> is understood as the largest catch that
  can be taken from fish stocks for an  period. The aim of this threshold is to
  achieve maximum efficiency of fish stocks while maintaining biodiversity and
  functioning of ecosystems relevant to present and future generations.<br> Fish
  stocks are considered to be sustainable if their numbers persist at a level
  that ensures maximum sustainable yield or higher.</p>

  </>In order to ensure that basic industrial species in the Baltic Sea are
  operated at a renewable level, <b>Regulation (EU) No 2016/1139 of the European
  Parliament and of the Council of 6 July 2016 has been drawn up and adopted
  establishing a multiannual plan for cod, herring and sprat in the Baltic Sea
  and the fisheries exploiting those stocks</b> (amending Council Regulation
  (EC) No 2187/2005 and repealing Council Regulation (EC) No 1098/2007).</p>

  <p>This regulation specifies the maximum level of fishing (Maximum sustainable
  yield) of the species in question by imposing conservation obligations,
  including maintaining or restoring populations of target species at renewable
  levels.</p>

  <p>The indicator adopts four dimensions, i.e .:<br> 1. proportion of fully
  exploited fish stocks<br> 2. proportion of fish stocks not fully exploited<br>
  3. proportion of fish stocks overexploited) and<br> 4. proportion of stocks
  within sustainable biological limit</p>

  <p><b>Sustainable levels include those fish stocks which, according to the
  stock assessment, were classified as "not fully exploited" and "fully
  exploited". The indicator is calculated as the sum of these two categories
  divided by the total number of fish species subject to resource assessment and
  multiplied by 100</b>.</p>

  <p>The assessment of stocks includes fish stocks as defined in Regulation (EU)
  No 2016/1139 of the European Parliament and of the Council for which a
  multi-annual plan has been established:<br> 1. Atlantic cod in the western
  part of the Baltic Sea<br> 2. Atlantic cod in the eastern part of the Baltic
  Sea<br> 3. Atlantic herring in the western part of the Baltic Sea<br> 4.
  Atlantic herring in the central part of the Baltic Sea<br> 5. sprat in the
  Baltic Sea.<br>
uwagi: >-
  Since 2012, the value of the percentage share is based on the analysis of 4
  stocks (ecluding  the eastern cod stock).
